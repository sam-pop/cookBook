## <a name="dec"></a> Project Description

FOODielicious is a website that was built in a few days as a front-end coding project.

We decided to create an interactive recipe search website that uses an API to get recipes from a remote server and delivers the results in an easy and simple manner.
You can use this website to search for all kind of different recipes! Just put in what you want to make, or even some of the ingredients you have and we'll (hopefully) find a match for you üòäÔ∏è

## <a name="tech"></a>What We Used

FOODielicious was created using HTML5,CSS3, [Bulma CSS framework](https://bulma.io/), JavaScript, jQuery, [jQueryUI](https://jqueryui.com/) and [EDAMAM recipe API](https://www.edamam.com/).

### Note

Since we are using the _free_ developer version of the [EDAMAM recipe API](https://www.edamam.com/) we are limited to 5 API calls per minute. 

So if you encounter any problems while using the site - just give it a minute :)

### <a name="fDev"></a>Future Development
- Migrate to a different API (better free tier)
- Make the website fully responsive on mobile for a variety of devices and screen sizes
