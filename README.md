## <a name="dec"></a> Project Description

FOODielicious is a website that was built in a few days as a front-end coding project.

We decided to create an interactive recipe search website that uses an API to get recipes from a remote server and delivers the results in an easy and simple manner. 
You can use this website to search for all kind of different recipes! Just put in what you want to make, or even some of the ingredients you have and we'll (hopefully) find a match for you 😊️ 

## <a name="tech"></a>What We Used

FOODielicious was created using HTML5,CSS3, [Bulma CSS framework](https://bulma.io/), JavaScript, jQuery, [jQueryUI](https://jqueryui.com/) and [EDAMAM recipe API](https://www.edamam.com/).
